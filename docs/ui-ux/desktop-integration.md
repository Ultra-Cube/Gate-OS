# Desktop Integration (Deepin Desktop Environment - DDE)

To accelerate a polished UX, Gate-OS can run atop DDE as an interim shell.

## Approach

- Provide install script to add DDE packages & session file.
- Abstract environment switch UI via future shell adapter interface.

## Pros / Cons

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Mature UI | Adds dependency footprint |
| Faster time-to-demo | Future migration effort |
| Theming baked-in | Potential performance overhead |

## Next Steps

1. Implement shell adapter interface (placeholder).
2. Provide environment list panel plugin concept.
