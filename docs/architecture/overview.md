## Architecture Overview

> Ultra Cube Tech â€” Foundation of the multi-environment OS.

## System Components

- Core OS
- Environment Manager
- Package Management
- Specialized Environments
- Telemetry & Observability (planned)
- Security & Policy Layer (planned)

## Logical Layers

| Layer | Responsibility | Tech (Draft) |
|-------|----------------|--------------|
| Kernel/Base | Performance, hardware | Ubuntu LTS + patches |
| Core Services | Auth, env registry | systemd services, DB (TBD) |
| Env Manager | Switch & orchestration | Python + GTK4 |
| Isolation / Containers | Environment encapsulation | Docker/Podman |
| UI Shell | UX & actions | GTK4 + Libadwaita |
| Telemetry | Metrics & logging | OpenTelemetry (planned) |

## Technical Stack

- Kernel, UI, containerization, etc.

## Environment Switching Flow (Sequence Outline)

1. User selects environment profile.
2. Manager validates dependencies.
3. Suspends conflicting services.
4. Activates target environment container set.
5. Applies performance & UI profile.
6. Emits events & telemetry.

## Configuration Strategy

- Declarative manifests per environment (YAML)
- Versioned schema with migration hooks

## Security Considerations (Draft)

- Principle of least privilege for env containers
- Signed manifest bundles
- Optional sandbox & MAC (AppArmor/SELinux) integration

## Open Questions

- Persistent state separation method
- Cross-environment resource sharing policy

## Notes

Iterate as components solidify.
