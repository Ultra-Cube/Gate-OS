## üéØ Overview

Gate-OS is a universal Linux distribution that unifies multiple specialized
environments‚Äîgaming, development, design, and media‚Äîinto a single, modular
operating system. Users can seamlessly switch between these environments,
each optimized for its purpose, without needing multiple OS installs.

### Elevator Pitch

Gate-OS turns one workstation into many purpose‚Äëbuilt machines ‚Äì without reboot rituals,
multi‚Äëboot clutter, or fragile dotfile juggling. Define an "environment" as code
(manifests + container bundle + profile) and switch in seconds. It's the convergence
layer between a traditional Linux distro, a developer platform, and a tuned
workstation appliance.

### Why It Matters

| Problem Today | Gate-OS Solution |
|---------------|------------------|
| Multiple OS installs for gaming/dev/design | Deterministic environment switching on one base install |
| Manual toolchain isolation | Declarative manifests + container encapsulation |
| Context switching overhead | One command / API trigger to pivot workflows |
| Drift & config snowball | Versioned, auditable environment definitions |
| Security friction | Capability allowlists & (future) sandbox/isolation profiles |

### Key Differentiators

- Environment-as-Code (EaC) schema: reproducible switching
- Pluggable orchestration: pre/post/shutdown hooks
- Container runtime abstraction (podman / docker / dry-run)
- Structured telemetry + OTLP export for fleet / ops insight
- Designed for future UI shell integration & remote companion control

### Vision in One Line

One OS install that becomes any workstation you need ‚Äì instantly, predictably, safely.

### Core Value

- One install, many roles
- Deterministic environment switching
- Modular, enterprise-aligned architecture

### Feature Matrix (Early Phase)

| Capability | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Manifest schema validation | ‚úÖ | JSON/YAML validated against spec |
| Switch orchestration core | ‚úÖ | Dry-run + container start pipeline |
| Container runtime detection | ‚úÖ | podman ‚Üí docker ‚Üí dry-run fallback |
| Plugin hooks (pre/post/shutdown) | ‚úÖ | Python entrypoints registry |
| Telemetry (stdout/file/OTLP) | ‚úÖ | Batch + atexit flush |
| Rate-limited Control API | ‚úÖ | Token auth + headers |
| Capability allowlist (security) | ‚úÖ | Enforced for security domain manifests |
| Isolation enforcement | üß™ | Stub ‚Äì profiles upcoming |
| Desktop shell integration | ‚è≥ | Phase 3 target |
| GUI Switch Panel | ‚è≥ | Planned after stable API |

More detail: [docs/product/features.md](docs/product/features.md)

---

## üîÑ Switching Concept (High-Level)

1. Validate target environment manifest
2. Quiesce conflicting services
3. Activate container bundle + apply profile
4. Refresh UI shell context
5. Emit telemetry event

### Cross-Environment Workflow (Design ‚Üí Media)

Blender (Design) outputs renders automatically showcased in the Media (Kodi) environment:

1. Blender container writes renders to `~/GateOS/work/design/renders`.
2. Export helper (`asset-export` in `examples/environments/design.yaml`) detects new files.
3. Helper triggers Kodi library refresh (planned plugin: `publish_to_kodi`).
4. Media environment (Kodi) surfaces latest assets for demo / review.

Benefit: frictionless creative iteration ‚Üí showcase loop; no manual copying.

---

## üß™ Early KPIs (Draft)

| Metric | Target (v1) |
|--------|-------------|
| Switch Latency | < 3s |
| Crash-Free Activation | > 99% |
| Memory Overhead | < 8% over base |
| Cold Boot to Ready | < 35s |

---

## üì¶ Installation

Prerequisites:

- Python 3.10+ (system package: `python3`, `python3-venv`)
- Git
- (Optional) `podman` or `docker` for future container integration

Clone & install (editable) with development and watch extras:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ultra-Cube/Gate-OS.git
cd Gate-OS
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e '.[dev,watch]'
```

Extras:

- `dev` ‚Äì testing, linting, tooling
- `watch` ‚Äì file watching (hot reload) via `watchdog`

Minimal runtime only:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Verify CLI is available:

```bash
gateos --help
```

### Quick Start (Dry-Run Demo)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ultra-Cube/Gate-OS.git
cd Gate-OS
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e '.[dev]'
GATEOS_API_TOKEN=$(gateos gen-token) gateos api &  # start API
curl -H "x-token: $GATEOS_API_TOKEN" http://localhost:8000/environments
```

Add a sample manifest under `examples/environments/dev.yaml` then perform a switch (placeholder endpoint once implemented):

```bash
curl -X POST -H "x-token: $GATEOS_API_TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d @examples/environments/dev.yaml http://localhost:8000/switch
```

---

## üë®‚Äçüíª Development Setup

Common one-liner after cloning:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -e '.[dev,watch]'
```

Run linters & tests:

```bash
ruff check .
pytest -q
```

Format code:

```bash
ruff format .
```

Run full coverage:

```bash
pytest --cov=gateos_manager --cov-report=term-missing
```

Update dependencies (if `pyproject.toml` changed):

```bash
pip install -e '.[dev,watch]' --upgrade
```

---

## üîê Auth Token & Security Basics

The Control API uses a simple token (temporary dev mechanism):

Generate a token:

```bash
gateos gen-token
```

Use via env var (fast):

```bash
export GATEOS_API_TOKEN="<token>"
```

Or store in file (default permissions 600):

```bash
gateos gen-token > ~/.config/gateos/token
export GATEOS_API_TOKEN_FILE=~/.config/gateos/token
```

Security capability allowlist is enforced for manifests in the `security` category ‚Äì see `docs/security/capability-policy.md`.

### Security Model (Foundations)

| Aspect | Current | Planned |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Auth | Static token (env/file) | OIDC / mTLS / per-env scopes |
| Capability Policy | Allowlist validation | Policy bundles + signing |
| Isolation | Logging stub | Seccomp/AppArmor profiles + namespaces |
| Supply Chain | Manual review | Signed manifest + provenance attestation |
| Secrets Handling | Env var pass-through (controlled) | Vault / KMS integration |

Threat model & hardening guidance will ship prior to first beta tag.

---

## üõ∞Ô∏è Running the Control API

Basic launch (port 8000):

```bash
GATEOS_API_TOKEN=$(gateos gen-token) gateos api --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Enable file watch (auto-reload manifests) & custom rate limit:

```bash
export GATEOS_WATCH=1          # enable watchdog reloads
export GATEOS_RATE_LIMIT=120   # requests/minute
GATEOS_API_TOKEN=$(gateos gen-token) gateos api
```

OpenAPI docs: <http://localhost:8000/docs>

Headers returned include rate limiting: `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`.

Switch example (curl):

```bash
curl -H "x-token: $GATEOS_API_TOKEN" http://localhost:8000/environments
```

---

## üîç Observability

Structured JSON logs go to stdout. Add a telemetry file sink:

```bash
export GATEOS_TELEMETRY_FILE=telemetry.log
GATEOS_API_TOKEN=$(gateos gen-token) gateos api
```

Correlation IDs are injected per request and emitted in both logs & telemetry events for traceability.

### Manifest Versioning (Draft)

Manifests optionally declare a top-level `schemaVersion` (currently `"1.0"`).

Behavior:

- If `schemaVersion` present and supported ‚Üí validated against packaged schema `environment-manifest-v<version>.yaml`.
- If absent ‚Üí falls back to provided schema path (legacy behavior).
- If unsupported ‚Üí load fails with a clear error.

Roadmap: multiple concurrent schema versions + upgrade assistant.

### Plugin Discovery

At startup the manager attempts to load Python entry point plugins in group `gateos.plugins`.
Each plugin entry point should resolve to a callable whose import triggers hook registration.

Disable auto discovery: `export GATEOS_DISABLE_ENTRYPOINT_PLUGINS=1`.

Hooks exposed:

- `pre_switch`
- `post_switch`
- `shutdown`

See: `docs/extensions/plugin-development.md` & `examples/plugins/`.

### Telemetry Modes

- Immediate: stdout/file JSON lines
- OTLP Single: each event POSTed individually
- OTLP Batch: queue + size/interval based flush + graceful atexit drain

Future: metrics aggregation, span modeling, structured switch performance stats.

## ü§ù Contributing

Read: [docs/contribution/governance.md](docs/contribution/governance.md)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ultra-Cube/Gate-OS.git
cd Gate-OS
./scripts/setup-dev-env.sh
pip install .[dev]  # install manager & dev tooling
gateos validate examples/environments/*.yaml --schema docs/architecture/schemas/environment-manifest.schema.yaml
pytest -q
```

Focus Areas: Core Manager, Environment Manifests, UI Shell, Security Isolation.

### Contribution Workflow (Condensed)

1. Fork & branch: `feature/<topic>`
2. Add/adjust manifest or code + tests
3. Run `ruff`, `pytest` (ensure green)
4. Update `CHANGELOG.md` under Unreleased
5. Open PR (template auto-applies) ‚Äì include rationale & risk notes
6. Merge on approval + passing CI

### Code Quality Tenets

- Deterministic over clever
- Explicit errors (no silent except unless telemetry)
- Minimal surface by default (opt-in features)
- Observability first (logs + telemetry event)
- No hidden global mutation outside designated managers

### Extensibility: Plugin Hooks

| Hook | Timing | Use Cases |
|------|--------|-----------|
| `pre_switch` | Before container activation | Policy gating, env diff checks |
| `post_switch` | After successful activation | UI refresh, metrics emission |
| `shutdown` | On orchestrator failure or process exit path | Cleanup, persistence |

Register via entry point or dynamic discovery (see `examples/plugins`).

| Will there be a GUI? | Yes ‚Äì shell integration is roadmap Phase 3. |

## üßæ Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Environment | Declarative bundle describing a role (tooling + policies). |
| Switch | Operation transitioning active environment context. |
| Manifest | JSON/YAML env definition validated against schema. |
| Capability Allowlist | Security gate restricting privileged ops. |
| Dry-Run Mode | Non-executing simulation of container operations. |
| Hook | Plugin callback executed at lifecycle points. |
| EaC | Environment-as-Code paradigm (like IaC for workstation roles). |
