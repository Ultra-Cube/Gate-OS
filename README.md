## 🎯 Overview

Gate-OS is a universal Linux distribution that unifies multiple specialized
environments—gaming, development, design, and media—into a single, modular
operating system. Users can seamlessly switch between these environments,
each optimized for its purpose, without needing multiple OS installs.

### Core Value

- One install, many roles
- Deterministic environment switching
- Modular, enterprise-aligned architecture

---

## 🌟 Vision & Mission (Summary)

See full: `docs/business/vision-mission.md`

| Pillar | Summary |
|--------|---------|
| Unified Experience | Seamless cross-domain workflows |
| Performance | Low-overhead switching & tuned profiles |
| Security & Trust | Isolation + auditable manifests |
| Community | Open governance, extensibility |

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Snapshot

Detailed design: `docs/architecture/overview.md`

```text
Core Kernel / Base
  ├─ Core Services (env registry, policy)
  ├─ Environment Manager (switch orchestration)
  ├─ Container Layer (Docker/Podman)
  ├─ UI Shell (GTK4 / Libadwaita)
  └─ Telemetry & Security (planned)
```

---

## 🚀 Current Status

Phase 2: Core System Development (≈40%)  
Refer to: `docs/roadmap/milestones.md`

| Phase | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| P1 Planning | ✅ | Complete |
| P2 Core Dev | 🔄 | Manager + UI work |
| P3 Environments | ⏳ | Spec refinement |

---

## 🛠️ Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|-------|------|
| Base | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (patched) |
| Manager | Python + GTK4 |
| Containers | Docker / Podman |
| UI | GTK4 + Libadwaita |
| Display | Wayland (X11 compat) |

---

## 🧩 Environments (Planned v1)

| Env | Focus | Key Tools |
|-----|-------|-----------|
| Gaming | Performance | Steam, Lutris, Proton |
| Dev | Toolchains | VS Code, Docker, K8s |
| Design | Creative | GIMP, Blender, Krita |
| Media | Production | Kodi, OBS, Resolve |

More detail: `docs/product/features.md`

---

## 🔄 Switching Concept (High-Level)

1. Validate target environment manifest
2. Quiesce conflicting services
3. Activate container bundle + apply profile
4. Refresh UI shell context
5. Emit telemetry event

---

## 🧪 Early KPIs (Draft)

| Metric | Target (v1) |
|--------|-------------|
| Switch Latency | < 3s |
| Crash-Free Activation | > 99% |
| Memory Overhead | < 8% over base |
| Cold Boot to Ready | < 35s |
